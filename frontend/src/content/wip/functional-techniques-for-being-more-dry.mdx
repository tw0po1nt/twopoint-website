title: Functional techniques for being more DRY
excerpt: While working on a new feature for my current client's system, I noticed quite a bit of duplication building up in the data access layer. While some duplication isn't true duplication, this was. In this post, we explore some functional techniques I used to clean it up.

## "Don't repeat yourself"

Every software developer learns (and abuses) this mantra at some point. The misapplications of DRY are [well documented](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=the+problems+with+DRY+in+programming), so I won't re-hash them here. Instead, my goal with this post is to show, by a real-world example, how you can address _true_ duplication in a codebase by applying some simple functional programming techniques.
